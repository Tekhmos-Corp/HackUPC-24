## Have you ever went to a buffet with a group of people and ordering for everyone escalated badly? With Join&Eat everyone can add themselves to the list and order
Just type your name and hit create room. Then share the code with your friends and you'll be in a collaborative list. Each of yourselves add what you want to order and when ordering just hit Summary, and you'll get your list


Try it out [here].
